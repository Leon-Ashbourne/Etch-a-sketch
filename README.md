#Etch-a-sketch

i created a sketchpad in a different version from the actual type. here you can play with them as much as you can . 
they will display different color at different time with different darkness . So play as much as you want. 

I provided reset button while an input method to decide how many grids do you want to have per side.
enjoy the game.. 

the function of the sketch-pad is same as others but you need to click on the place you want to start your drawing to be.
reset option will erase whole squares so be careful when using reset option.
