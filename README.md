#Etch-a-sketch

i created a sketchpad in a different version from the actual type. here you can play with them as much as you can . 
they will display different color at different time with different darkness . So play as much as you want. 

I provided reset button while an input method to decide how many grids do you want to have per side.
enjoy the game..
